## Summary
Visionary cybersecurity leader with two decades of responding to sophisticated threats with human-centric, anti-fragile defenses.  
I build resilient, self-strengthening systems that thrive under pressure and embed the motivation-driven behavior change central to digital trust.  
By fostering collaborative innovation, I distill technical complexity into clear, executive-ready strategies that inspire partners and customers, delivering measurable outcomes through persuasive influence rather than command.  
Where most see firewalls, I design future-proof security architectures with a human core.
