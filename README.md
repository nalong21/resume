- Visionary cybersecurity leader with two decades of responding to sophisticated threats with human-centric, anti-fragile defenses.

- By fostering collaborative innovation, I distill technical complexity into clear, executive-ready strategies that inspire partners and customers, delivering measurable outcomes through persuasive influence rather than command.
